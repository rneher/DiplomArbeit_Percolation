# Diploma Thesis on Percolation and stochastic geometry

This thesis was done in the lab of Prof.~Herbert Wagner at the University of Munich in 2003.
The bulk of the results have been published in the article [Topological estimation of percolation thresholds](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/01/P01011/meta) in the Journal JSTAT.
